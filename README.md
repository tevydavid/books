# Tevy Jacobs-Gomes Portfolio
##Front End Showcase

This repo is designed to showcase my front end technical skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript in a holistic manner.

**Please add new books and explore the [webpage](http://www.tevydavid.com/books)**

###Features:

- Responsive Web Design optimized for mobile and desktop.
- The 'mobile' view has a menu icon, which when clicked, opens the menu and reveals the menu items.
- The 'desktop' view shows the menu items inline, and the menu icon is not needed.


####Interaction:
1. In the “Welcome back!” component:
	* a. Clicking yes will bring up a form to enter information about the book (Title, Author, etc)
	* b. Clicking no will close the component
2. When the new book form is submitted a new book component is populated and rendered on the page.
	* c. Book component validates for presence of title and author and checks for duplicate entries.


####Technical Specs:
1. React.js book, nav, and sponsored content components.
2. Semantic markup for SEO.
3. Commonly used breakpoint for your responsive styles.
4. Best practice html tags for accessibility.
