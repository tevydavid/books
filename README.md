##Bigcommerce Front End Technical Test

This test is designed to evaluate front end technical skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript in a holistic manner.  That is, the ability to create a solution from requirements in a manner that is clean and maintainable.  To that end, code structure and modularity are important, while things like pixel perfection with an associate mockup is less relevant.

Please take your time (within reason) to find a solution that you are happy with.  Libraries and frameworks are allowed, as long as the code you provide gives an indication of your own skill (ie, don't use Bootstrap without any of your own custom styles).  Comment your code where functionality or usage isn't obvious as well as to explain decisions that you've made in designing your solution.

###Feature Requirements:
Build the UI as represented in the mockups included in the “screenshots” folder.
Included are a ’mobile' view and a 'desktop' view, so please think about responsive design in
your solution as well as cross-browser compatibility for the latest versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox and IE).

- The 'mobile' view has a menu icon, which when clicked, opens the menu and reveals the 3 menu items.
- The 'desktop' view shows the 3 menu items inline, and the menu icon is not needed.
- Don’t worry about persistence of data entered from the form above.  
- Always consider site speed and accessibility in your solution.
- Consider writing reusable code/component when building this application.

##### Assets
- The icons for the mobile view have been attached for your convenience.
- Font used: http://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Roboto

####Interaction Requirements:
1. In the “Welcome back!” component:
	* a. Clicking yes will bring up a form to enter information about the book (Title, Author, etc)
	* b. Clicking no will close the component
2. When the form from 1a is submitted, populate a new component for that book, and render it on the page.
	* c. Do some simple validation on the content to prevent duplicate entries.

#####Optional: 
1. Add the ability to add reviews and create a star indicator based on those reviews (1 to 5 scale);
2. Add sorting based on different attributes of the data (e.g., book title)

####Technical Requirements:
1. Create JSON representations of the content.
2. Use templates which will provide the markup and populate the content on the page.
3. Identify and use a commonly used breakpoint for your responsive styles.
